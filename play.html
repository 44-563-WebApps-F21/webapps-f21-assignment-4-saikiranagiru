<h2>Vera or, The Nihilists</h2>
<h3>ACT III_Same scene and business as Act I. Man in yellow dress, with drawn sword, at the door._</h3>
<p>PRESIDENT. What hour is it?

    FIRST CONSP. The hour to strike.
    
    PRES. What day?
    
    SECOND CONSP. The day of Marat.[1]
    
    PRES. In what month?
    
    SECOND CONSP. The month of liberty.
    
    PRES. What is our duty?
    
    FOURTH CONSP. To obey.
    
    PRES. Our creed?
    
    FIFTH CONSP. Parbleu, Mons. le President, I never knew you had one.
    
    CONSPS. A spy! A spy! Unmask! Unmask! A spy!
    
    PRES. [2]Let the doors be shut. There are others but Nihilists
    present.[2]
    
    CONSPS. Unmask! Unmask! [3]Kill him! kill him![3] (_Masked CONSPIRATOR
    unmasks._) Prince Paul!
    
    VERA. Devil! Who lured you into the lion's den?
    
    CONSPS. Kill him! kill him![4]
    
    PRINCE PAUL. En vérité, Messieurs, you are not over-hospitable in your
    welcome.
    
    VERA. Welcome! What welcome should we give you but the dagger or the
    noose?
    
    PRINCE PAUL. I had no idea, really, that the Nihilists were so
    exclusive. Let me assure you that if I had not always had an _entree_
    to the very best society, and the very worst conspiracies, I could never
    have been Prime Minister in Russia.
    
    VERA. The tiger cannot change its nature, nor the snake lose its venom;
    but are you turned a lover of the people?
    
    PRINCE PAUL. Mon Dieu, non, Mademoiselle! I would much sooner talk
    scandal in a drawing-room than treason in a cellar. Besides, I hate the
    common mob, who smell of garlic, smoke bad tobacco, get up early, and
    dine off one dish.
    
    PRES. What have you to gain, then, by a revolution?
    
    PRINCE PAUL. Mon ami, I have nothing left to lose. That scatter-brained
    boy, this new Czar, has banished me.
    
    VERA. To Siberia?
    
    PRINCE PAUL. No, to Paris. He has confiscated my estates, robbed me of
    my office and my cook. I have nothing left but my decorations. I am here
    for revenge.[5]
    
    PRES. Then you have a right to be one of us. [5]We also meet daily for
    revenge.[5]
    
    PRINCE PAUL. You want money, of course. No one ever joins a conspiracy
    who has any. Here. (_Throws money on table._) You have so many spies
    that I should think you want information. Well, you will find me the
    best informed man in Russia on the abuses of our Government. I made them
    nearly all myself.
    
    VERA. President, I don't trust this man. He has done us too much harm in
    Russia to let him go in safety.
    
    PRINCE PAUL. Believe me, Mademoiselle, you are wrong; I will be a most
    valuable addition to your circle; as for you, gentlemen, if I had not
    thought that you would be useful to me I shouldn't have risked my neck
    among you, or dined an hour earlier than usual so as to be in time.
    
    PRES. Ay, if he had wanted to spy on us, Vera, he wouldn't have come
    himself.
    
    PRINCE PAUL (_aside_). No; I should have sent my best friend.
    
    PRES. Besides, Vera, he is just the man to give us the information we
    want about some business we have in hand to-night.
    
    VERA. Be it so if you wish it.
    
    PRES. Brothers, is it your will that Prince Paul Maraloffski be
    admitted, and take the oath of the Nihilist?
    
    CONSPS. It is! it is!
    
    PRES. (_holding out dagger and a paper_). Prince Paul, the dagger or the
    oath?
    
    PRINCE PAUL (_smiles sardonically_). I would sooner annihilate than be
    annihilated. (_Takes paper._)
    
    PRES. Remember: [6]Betray us, and as long as the earth holds poison or
    steel, as long as men can strike or woman betray, you shall not escape
    vengeance.[6] The Nihilists never forget their friends, or forgive their
    enemies.
    
    PRINCE PAUL. Really? I did not think you were so civilized.
    
    VERA (_pacing up and down_). Why is he not here? He will not keep the
    crown. I know him well.
    
    PRES. Sign. (_PRINCE PAUL signs_.) You said you thought we had no creed.
    You were wrong. Read it!
    
    VERA. This is a dangerous thing, President. What can we do with this
    man?
    
    PRES. We can use him.
    
    VERA. And afterwards?
    
    PRES. (_shrugging his shoulders_). Strangle him.
    
    PRINCE PAUL (_reading_). "The rights of humanity!" In the old times men
    carried out their rights for themselves as they lived, but nowadays
    every baby seems born with a social manifesto in its mouth much bigger
    than itself.[7] "Nature is not a temple, but a workshop: we demand the
    right to labour." Ah, I shall surrender my own rights in that respect.
    
    VERA (_pacing up and down behind_). Oh, will he never come? will he
    never come?
    
    PRINCE PAUL. "The family as subversive of true socialistic and communal
    unity is to be annihilated." Yes, President, I agree completely with
    Article 5. A family is a terrible incumbrance, especially when one is
    not married. (_Three knocks at the door._)
    
    VERA. Alexis at last!
    
    _Password._ Væ tyrannis!
    
    _Answer._ Væ victis!
    
    (_Enter MICHAEL STROGANOFF._)
    
    PRES.[8] Michael, the regicide! Brothers, let us do honour to a man who
    has killed a king.
    
    [9]VERA (_aside_). Oh, he will come yet.[9]</p>
